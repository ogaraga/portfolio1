            <P>Learning is dynamic. It is just like a seed that is being planted with a specific purpose with the assurance that one
                day it will decay, wear a new body, springs off the soil and starts tending up, then it grows. It's continuous existence as it grows
                gives it the opportunity to tap from the soil from where it sprang up and eventaully matures to regenerate into Its
                kinds. The 'kinds' here symbolizes multiplicity of impacts and coverage/expansion which ranges from finances to social values.
                As it pays to seed, so it is and will continue to be; learning. I seek a new challenge and a ground that is ripen with learning however though 
                it may seem. Good life and growth are in the domain of measurable and defined challenges which come with a good cost.
                Meeting new people of practical and social powerful stance is a desire always pruned. Working with cross-racial and diversed-religious personality will helpme build good
                 thought about life and the people therein. I am a go-getter and very jealous at what i do to earn a living. I don't compromise nor bend rules set out by my employer unless the instance at which it creates/gives good financial shore-up for 
                my company as that is the bedrock of its existence/establishment while creating values for people.
                I am Careful and accurate web-developer with mastery on HTML/CSS/SASS/JAVASCRIPTS/REACTS.JS/NODES.JS etc.
                I have built some web-based profiles and landing pages which make the eyes glue at an instance of perusal.
                I have excellent knowledge in the operations of computing packages like Ms Words, Ms Excel AND Powerpoint.
                Few financial institutions around my sphers of contact have had my presence. Three of these are: The United Bank For Africa(UBA PLC),
                XpatFunds Financial Services Aba and Mainstreet Bank. I was given the opportune time to work as an IT and customer service personnel. This indeed has given super skills
                in good networking and human relationship.
                I have some weakneses which are just limited to Having zero tolerance to fraud, Attention to details, thrift with expences,
                zero tolerance to disproportionate lies. I have few strenght like working with team, meeting deadlines, integrity, sportsmanship, ownership spirit, going the extra-miles and a go-getting spirit among many others.
